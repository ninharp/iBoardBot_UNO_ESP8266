# iBoardBot Variant with an Arduino UNO and any ESP8266 with AT Firmware

## Overview
This projects is in general a fork of the original repository of (jjrobots)[https://github.com/jjrobots/iBoardbot] which is not suitable for me
due to the lack of the Devian Control Board and/or a suitable atmega32u4 as replacement... but i got a bunch of old Arduino Nano and also some CNC Shields.
So i decided to use this as my control board for the iBoardBot.

Work is still in progress since i was in need to restructure the whole firmware and its still ongoing ;)
